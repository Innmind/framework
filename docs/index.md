# Framework

The philosophy behind this framework is to have a minimalist foundation to be able to build simple apps but can also accomodate for more complex applications through composition (of the configuration, commands, request handlers and more).

Another important design is to expose to you the input to handle and an abstraction of the operating system it runs on so you only need to focus on _what_ your app needs to do and _not how_.
